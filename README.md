# Stock magnet

Final project for the Building AI course
Stock magnet

## Summary

Program to buy and sell shares based on moving averages. 

## Background

Teaching a program to recognize when a stock consistently trades above it’s 20 day moving average taking into account other factors so that stocks can be bought at the right time to maximize profits.  


## How is it used?
Casual and long term stock traders. Identifying the correct entry point is crucial to making a profit from stocks in a 4 to 6 month time frame. 

## Data sources and AI methods
Stock chart data (available online. Proposed training data is 365 days of top ten fortune 500 companies.) 30 day simple moving average. 200 day simple moving average. 5 day exponential moving average. Buy volume. RSI (relative strength indicator.) AI will have to learn four stages of stock. Balance trading above average taking into account buy volumes. 

## Challenges

Buy/sell Execution would be too important. It would have to give a notification only when the right time had come

## What next?

If the program got accurate enough it could be trusted to buy/sell stock on it’s own as long as buy and sell stops were built in to ensure safety
